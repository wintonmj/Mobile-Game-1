# Service Layer - Overview

## Problem Statement

Our mobile game architecture currently suffers from:

1. **Tightly coupled components** - Controllers handle UI interactions and business logic simultaneously
2. **Decentralized asset management** - Lack of specialized services for different asset types
3. **Poor separation of concerns** - Direct manipulation of models by controllers
4. **Code duplication** - Common functionality reimplemented across different scenes
5. **Rigid component communication** - Direct references between components limit flexibility
6. **Performance bottlenecks** - Frequent object creation/destruction leads to GC pauses
7. **Limited extensibility** - Hardcoded configuration values make balancing difficult

## Solution Approach

We will implement a comprehensive service layer following these design principles:
- **Single Responsibility** - Each service focuses on one domain of functionality
- **Dependency Injection** - Services injected into controllers, not instantiated directly
- **Interface-driven Design** - Clear interfaces enable easy mocking for tests
- **Loose Coupling** - Communication through well-defined interfaces and events
- **Phaser Integration** - Services properly integrate with Phaser's lifecycle

### Core Services

Our service layer will include 10 core services:
1. **Asset Service** ✓ - Centralized asset preloading, access, memory management, and optimization
2. **Animation Service** - Animation creation and management
3. **Input Service** - Unified input handling across different devices
4. **Physics Service** - Collision detection and movement with physics
5. **Game State Service** - Game state management and persistence
6. **Audio Service** - Sound and music playback
7. **Logger Service** - Logging and performance monitoring
8. **Event Bus Service** ✓ - Decoupled component communication
9. **Object Pool Service** - Memory optimization through object reuse
10. **Configuration Service** ✓ - External configuration for game balancing

### Unified Registry

A central registry will manage:
- Service instantiation and retrieval ✓
- Component factory registration
- Dependency resolution ✓
- Lifecycle management

## Completed Services

### AssetService ✓
The AssetService provides comprehensive asset management capabilities:

- **Asset Registration & Loading**
  - Registration of different asset types (images, audio, JSON, etc.)
  - Batch asset preloading with progress tracking
  - On-demand loading for individual assets
  
- **Asset Retrieval**
  - Type-safe retrieval methods for different asset types
  - Automatic last-used tracking for assets
  
- **Memory Management**
  - Asset releasing (both individual and bulk)
  - Memory usage tracking and estimation
  - Memory threshold warnings and critical events
  - Memory monitoring with configurable intervals
  
- **Performance Optimization**
  - Cache policy enforcement
  - Cache pruning strategies (LRU, Size-based, Hybrid)
  - Asset grouping for logical organization
  - Event emission for monitoring and debugging

### EventBusService ✓
A type-safe event communication system that enables:

- Publish-subscribe pattern for decoupled communication
- Strong typing of events and subscribers
- Event history tracking for debugging
- Subscription management and cleanup

### ConfigurationService ✓
External configuration management for runtime configuration:

- Environment-specific configuration (dev, test, prod)
- Configuration loading from JSON files
- Default value fallbacks
- Type-safe configuration access

### Registry ✓
A centralized registry that manages:

- Service registration and retrieval
- Dependency resolution
- Service lifecycle management

## Key Benefits

This service layer design:
1. **Reduces coupling** through event-based communication
2. **Improves performance** via object pooling and resource management
3. **Enhances flexibility** with external configuration
4. **Simplifies testing** with interfaces and dependency injection
5. **Provides incremental value** through phased implementation
6. **Optimizes memory usage** with pooling and resource management
7. **Supports gradual migration** from current architecture

## Migration Strategy

We will adopt a gradual approach to migration:
1. Create adapter services to bridge old and new patterns
2. Start with non-critical services
3. Support parallel operation during transition
4. Follow consistent naming and organization conventions 

## Next Steps

1. Continue with Phase 2 implementation:
   - Create AnimationService
   - Build ObjectPoolService
   - Develop GameStateService
   
2. Prepare for Phase 3 by:
   - Documenting integration points for remaining services
   - Drafting interface specifications for Phase 3 services
   - Identifying performance optimization opportunities
   
3. Start integrating existing completed services with controllers to validate the design
