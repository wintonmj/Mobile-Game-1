# Service Layer - Overview

## Problem Statement

Our mobile game architecture currently suffers from:

1. **Tightly coupled components** - Controllers handle UI interactions and business logic simultaneously
2. **Decentralized asset management** - Lack of specialized services for different asset types
3. **Poor separation of concerns** - Direct manipulation of models by controllers
4. **Code duplication** - Common functionality reimplemented across different scenes
5. **Rigid component communication** - Direct references between components limit flexibility
6. **Performance bottlenecks** - Frequent object creation/destruction leads to GC pauses
7. **Limited extensibility** - Hardcoded configuration values make balancing difficult

## Solution Approach

We will implement a comprehensive service layer following these design principles:
- **Single Responsibility** - Each service focuses on one domain of functionality
- **Dependency Injection** - Services injected into controllers, not instantiated directly
- **Interface-driven Design** - Clear interfaces enable easy mocking for tests
- **Loose Coupling** - Communication through well-defined interfaces and events
- **Phaser Integration** - Services properly integrate with Phaser's lifecycle

### Core Services

Our service layer will include 10 core services:
1. **Asset Service** - Centralized asset preloading and access
2. **Animation Service** - Animation creation and management
3. **Input Service** - Unified input handling across different devices
4. **Physics Service** - Collision detection and movement with physics
5. **Game State Service** - Game state management and persistence
6. **Audio Service** - Sound and music playback
7. **Logger Service** - Logging and performance monitoring
8. **Event Bus Service** - Decoupled component communication
9. **Object Pool Service** - Memory optimization through object reuse
10. **Configuration Service** - External configuration for game balancing

### Unified Registry

A central registry will manage:
- Service instantiation and retrieval
- Component factory registration
- Dependency resolution
- Lifecycle management

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation (2 weeks)
- Implement Registry system
- Create EventBusService
- Build minimal configuration service
- Establish Phaser lifecycle integration
- Set up testing infrastructure

### Phase 2: Core Services (3 weeks)
- Implement AssetService and AnimationService
- Create InputService
- Build ObjectPoolService
- Develop GameStateService basics

### Phase 3: Performance & Integration (2 weeks)
- Add performance metrics to services
- Implement PhysicsService
- Complete AudioService implementation
- Enhance ConfigurationService
- Add LoggerService

### Phase 4: Controller Refactoring (3 weeks)
- Create adapter patterns for legacy code
- Refactor core controllers to use services
- Update UI controllers to use the service layer

### Phase 5: Advanced Features (2 weeks)
- Implement advanced dependency resolution
- Add service discovery capabilities
- Create plugin architecture
- Implement error handling and recovery
- Add performance optimizations

## Key Benefits

This service layer design:
1. **Reduces coupling** through event-based communication
2. **Improves performance** via object pooling and resource management
3. **Enhances flexibility** with external configuration
4. **Simplifies testing** with interfaces and dependency injection
5. **Provides incremental value** through phased implementation
6. **Optimizes memory usage** with pooling and resource management
7. **Supports gradual migration** from current architecture

## Migration Strategy

We will adopt a gradual approach to migration:
1. Create adapter services to bridge old and new patterns
2. Start with non-critical services
3. Support parallel operation during transition
4. Follow consistent naming and organization conventions
