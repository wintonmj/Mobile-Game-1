# Service Layer Documentation

This document has been reorganized into multiple smaller documents for better maintainability and focus.

## Document Structure

1. **[ServiceLayer-Overview.md](ServiceLayer-Overview.md)** - High-level overview of the service layer architecture, including problem statement, solution approach, and implementation plan.

2. **Component Documents**
   - **[ServiceLayer-Registry.md](ServiceLayer-Registry.md)** - Details the Registry component that manages service instantiation and dependencies
   - **[ServiceLayer-EventBus.md](ServiceLayer-EventBus.md)** - Covers the EventBus service for decoupled component communication
   - **[ServiceLayer-ObjectPool.md](ServiceLayer-ObjectPool.md)** - Explains the ObjectPool service for efficient object reuse and memory management
   - **[ServiceLayer-Configuration.md](ServiceLayer-Configuration.md)** - Describes the Configuration service for managing game settings across environments
   - More component documents to follow for:
     - Asset Service
     - Animation Service
     - Input Service
     - Physics Service
     - Game State Service
     - Audio Service

The new document structure is designed to make it easier to:
- Focus on specific components
- Find relevant implementation details
- Update documentation incrementally
- Track individual component progress

Each component document includes:
1. The specific problem it addresses
2. How it fits into the overall service layer plan
3. A test-driven development approach for implementation
4. Integration patterns with other services
5. Migration strategies

Please refer to the individual documents for detailed information.
