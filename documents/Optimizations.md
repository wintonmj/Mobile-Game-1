# Optimizations Design Document

## Overview

This document outlines optimization opportunities for our mobile game, focusing on improvements to modularity, extensibility, and performance. The optimizations are prioritized based on impact on code maintainability, performance, and future extensibility.

## Extendability Priorities

The following optimizations are ranked by their impact on the system's extendability:

1. Service Layer Implementation (✓ In progress - see ServiceLayer.md)
2. ~~Component Registry & Dependency Injection~~ (✓ Integrated with ServiceRegistry)
3. ~~Event Bus System~~ (✓ Integrated as EventBusService)
4. State Management System
5. Strategy Pattern Extensions
6. ~~Configuration Externalization~~ (✓ Integrated as ConfigurationService)

> **Note:** Component Registry, Event Bus, and Configuration have been integrated directly into our Service Layer implementation to provide a more cohesive architecture. See ServiceLayer.md for the complete design.

## Service Layer

### Problem Statement
Business logic is currently tightly coupled with controllers, making it difficult to reuse across different parts of the application. This creates code duplication and complicates testing.

### Solution Overview
Implement a service layer to encapsulate business logic and provide it to controllers through dependency injection.

> **Implementation Status:** In progress - See ServiceLayer.md for the complete implementation plan.

### Benefits
- **Separates concerns**: Business logic lives outside controllers
- **Promotes reusability**: Services can be used by multiple controllers
- **Improves testability**: Services can be mocked easily
- **Enables extensions**: New game features can be added as services without modifying existing code

## ~~Component Registry~~ (Now part of ServiceRegistry)

> **Note:** The Component Registry concept has been integrated with the ServiceRegistry in our Service Layer design. This unified approach simplifies the architecture while maintaining all the benefits of the original component registry concept.

### Why We Consolidated This
We determined that maintaining separate registries for services and components would:
1. Create unnecessary complexity with multiple similar systems
2. Make dependency resolution between services and components more difficult
3. Introduce potential inconsistencies in how we manage game objects
4. Add cognitive overhead for developers working with both systems

The integrated Registry in ServiceLayer.md now handles both service and component management with a more robust design.

## ~~Event Bus~~ (Now part of Service Layer as EventBusService)

> **Note:** The Event Bus has been implemented as a first-class service (EventBusService) in our Service Layer design. This approach ensures that all components have access to a standardized communication mechanism.

### Why We Integrated This
By making the Event Bus a core service rather than a separate system:
1. We ensure consistent access to event-based communication throughout the codebase
2. We can easily implement event logging and debugging as part of the service
3. We can provide typed event interfaces through TypeScript
4. We maintain a single system for both service-to-service and component-to-component communication

## Object Pooling

### Problem Statement
Creating and destroying game objects frequently causes garbage collection pauses and performance issues.

### Solution Overview
Implement an object pool for frequently used game objects.

> **Implementation Status:** Integrated as ObjectPoolService in the Service Layer design.

### Benefits
- **Reduced GC pauses**: Fewer objects created and destroyed
- **Improved performance**: Object reuse is faster than creation
- **Memory management**: Better control over memory usage
- **Consistent behavior**: Reduces allocation-related bugs

## ~~External Configuration~~ (Now part of Service Layer as ConfigurationService)

> **Note:** External configuration has been integrated as the ConfigurationService in our Service Layer design. This service provides enhanced functionality for managing environment-specific configurations.

### Why We Integrated This
By making Configuration part of the Service Layer:
1. All services can easily access configuration values
2. We can implement environment-specific configuration (dev/test/prod)
3. We can provide validation of configuration values
4. We maintain a consistent approach to configuration throughout the application

## State Management System (Future)

### Problem Statement
Game state is managed inconsistently across different parts of the application, making it difficult to track state changes and ensure data consistency.

### Solution Overview
Implement a centralized state management system with support for transactions, history, and state observation.

### Component Design

```typescript
// State management interface
export interface IStateManager<T> {
  getState(): T;
  setState(newState: Partial<T>): void;
  subscribe(listener: (state: T, changes: Partial<T>) => void): () => void;
  undo(): boolean;
  redo(): boolean;
  resetState(): void;
}

// Implementation
export class StateManager<T> implements IStateManager<T> {
  private currentState: T;
  private history: Array<T>;
  private historyPointer: number;
  private listeners: Array<(state: T, changes: Partial<T>) => void>;
  
  constructor(initialState: T) {
    this.currentState = { ...initialState };
    this.history = [this.currentState];
    this.historyPointer = 0;
    this.listeners = [];
  }
  
  // Implementation details...
}
```

### Benefits
- **Centralized state**: Single source of truth for game state
- **Predictable changes**: State changes follow a consistent pattern
- **Debugging support**: State history facilitates debugging
- **Observable changes**: Components can react to state changes

### Integration Plan
1. Define core game state interfaces
2. Implement state manager with history support
3. Add state change observability
4. Create specialized state slices for different game domains

## Strategy Pattern Extensions (Future)

### Problem Statement
Game behaviors are often hardcoded, making it difficult to modify or extend gameplay mechanics without changing existing code.

### Solution Overview
Implement strategy patterns for key game mechanics, allowing runtime behavior swapping and extension.

### Component Design

```typescript
// Strategy interface
export interface IMovementStrategy {
  calculateMovement(entity: Entity, input: InputState): Vector2;
}

// Concrete strategy implementations
export class GridMovementStrategy implements IMovementStrategy {
  calculateMovement(entity: Entity, input: InputState): Vector2 {
    // Grid-based movement logic
  }
}

export class FreeMovementStrategy implements IMovementStrategy {
  calculateMovement(entity: Entity, input: InputState): Vector2 {
    // Free movement logic
  }
}

// Strategy context
export class MovementController {
  private strategy: IMovementStrategy;
  
  constructor(strategy: IMovementStrategy) {
    this.strategy = strategy;
  }
  
  setStrategy(strategy: IMovementStrategy): void {
    this.strategy = strategy;
  }
  
  move(entity: Entity, input: InputState): void {
    const movement = this.strategy.calculateMovement(entity, input);
    entity.position.add(movement);
  }
}
```

### Benefits
- **Runtime swappable behavior**: Change game mechanics without code changes
- **Extensible design**: Add new behaviors without modifying existing code
- **Improved testability**: Test strategies in isolation
- **Clear separation**: Decouple behavior implementation from usage

### Integration Plan
1. Identify key game systems for strategy pattern application
2. Define strategy interfaces for each system
3. Implement concrete strategy classes
4. Refactor existing code to use strategy pattern
5. Add configuration for strategy selection

## Implementation Priorities

### Short-term (1-2 sprints)
1. Complete Service Layer foundation (see ServiceLayer.md)
2. Implement EventBusService (integrated with Service Layer)
3. Develop ObjectPoolService for common game objects
4. Create ConfigurationService with external file support

### Medium-term (2-3 sprints)
1. Refactor controllers to use service layer
2. Implement remaining core services
3. Add comprehensive service tests
4. Develop state management system

### Long-term (3+ sprints)
1. Implement strategy patterns for game mechanics
2. Add plugin architecture for extensibility
3. Create additional optimization services
4. Develop advanced performance monitoring

## Test Considerations

### Test Strategy
- Unit tests for all services and components
- Integration tests for service interactions
- Performance tests to ensure optimizations are effective
- Memory leak detection in automated tests

### Test Coverage Goals
- 90%+ coverage for service layer
- 80%+ coverage for controllers
- Key performance paths fully covered

## Performance Metrics

To measure the impact of optimizations:

1. **Frame rate**: Target consistent 60 FPS
2. **Memory usage**: Monitor and reduce peak memory
3. **Load time**: Target <3s initial load
4. **GC pauses**: Reduce frequency and duration
5. **Asset loading time**: Optimize asset loading pipeline

## Conclusion

Our optimization strategy has been updated to focus on a more cohesive approach:

1. **Service Layer** now forms the foundation of our architecture, with integrated:
   - Component Registry (as part of ServiceRegistry)
   - Event Bus (as EventBusService)
   - Object Pooling (as ObjectPoolService)
   - Configuration management (as ConfigurationService)

2. **Future Optimizations** will build on this foundation:
   - State Management System
   - Strategy Pattern Extensions

By implementing a comprehensive Service Layer first, we've created a solid foundation for all other optimization work while maintaining a clean, modular architecture. This approach avoids duplication and ensures consistency across our codebase.
