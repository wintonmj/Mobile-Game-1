## MVC Architecture Guidelines

### Models
- Models represent the data and business logic
- Place all model classes in the `src/models` directory
- Models should be independent of views and controllers
- Models should have clearly defined interfaces
- Models should emit events when data changes

### Views
- Views represent the UI components
- Place all view-related code in the `src/views` directory
- Views should subscribe to model changes and update accordingly
- Views should delegate user interactions to controllers
- Use Phaser.Scene as the base class for game scenes

### Controllers
- Controllers handle user input and update models accordingly
- Place all controller classes in the `src/controllers` directory
- Controllers connect models and views
- Controllers should not contain business logic
- Use dependency injection to provide models to controllers
