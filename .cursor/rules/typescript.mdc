 TypeScript Guidelines
Always use TypeScript for new files with proper type annotations
Prefer interfaces over types for object shapes
Use type inference where it's clear, but explicitly declare return types for functions
Use enums for related constants
Use union types for variables that can be one of several types
Avoid using any type unless absolutely necessary
Use optional parameters and properties with the ? syntax
Use generics when creating reusable components
Use readonly for immutable properties
Always define proper return types for functions and methods
