# Documentation Completeness Review Process

1. Verify core documentation coverage:
   - Implementation plans
   - Architecture designs
   - Technical specifications
   - Testing strategies

2. Check alignment between:
   - Implementation code
   - Documentation
   - Test coverage

3. Identify gaps in:
   - Development workflows
   - Technical decisions
   - Implementation details
   - Integration points

4. Key questions to assess:
   - Are all features properly documented?
   - Do implementation guides match the codebase?
   - Are there clear examples for major components?
   - Is the documentation actionable for developers?
   - Are technical decisions sufficiently explained?

5. Recommended additions before implementation:
   [Add recommendations based on documentation analysis]

Review all of @docs  with a focus on @Sprint1ImplementationPlan.md 

Is there any additional docs or planning that you recommend we prepare before starting on the implementation?
