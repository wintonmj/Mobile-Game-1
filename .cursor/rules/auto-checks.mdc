 Rule Name: auto-checks.mdc
Description:
Automated Code Quality Checks
This rule enforces running the run_checks() function from run.sh whenever code changes are made.
The run_checks() function performs the following validations:
Linting (npm run lint)
Code formatting (npm run format)
Unit tests (npm run test)
TypeScript type checking (tsc --noEmit)
Build verification (npm run build)
Dead code detection
These checks help maintain code quality by ensuring:
Consistent code style and formatting
All tests pass
TypeScript types are valid
The application builds successfully
No dead or deprecated code is present
To manually run checks:
Execute ./run.sh check to run once
Execute ./run.sh watch or just ./run.sh to watch for changes
