## AssetService Implementation Plan

The AssetService is a core component of our game engine's asset management system. It provides centralized control over asset loading, caching, and memory management to ensure optimal game performance and resource utilization.
This service is responsible for handling all game assets including textures, audio, models, and other game resources.
See design doc: /docs/asset-service-design.md

   - Add automatic texture compression
   - Create dynamic quality adjustment
   - Implement background loading optimization
   - Write tests for optimization strategies

### Phase 6: Extension and Integration
1. **Plugin System**
   - Create AssetService plugin architecture
   - Implement custom loader support
   - Add format conversion plugins
   - Create compression plugins
   - Write tests for plugin system

2. **Advanced Features**
