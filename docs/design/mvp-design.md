## Design Philosophy
The MVP focuses on establishing the fundamental gameplay loop while maintaining the project's core identity as a rich, choice-driven RPG. We prioritize features that:
1. Demonstrate the game's unique value proposition
2. Provide immediate player engagement
3. Can be implemented efficiently with our technical stack (Phaser.js, TypeScript, Vite)
4. Create a foundation for future expansion

## Technical Implementation Priorities

For detailed technical architecture and implementation details, see `docs/architecture/patterns/MVPHighLevelArchitecture.md`.

### Phase 1: Core Engine Setup
1. Project structure setup (following `ProjectStructure.md` Phase 1)
2. Basic scene management
3. Character movement and controls
4. Simple combat mechanics
5. Basic UI framework

### Phase 2: Game Systems
1. Character creation and persistence
2. Inventory system
3. Basic quest framework
4. Simple NPC interactions
5. Resource gathering mechanics

### Phase 3: Content Implementation
1. Main town construction
2. Starting region design
3. Core quest implementation
4. Essential NPC placement
5. Basic crafting system

## Technical Architecture
The technical implementation of this MVP follows the architecture defined in `docs/architecture/patterns/MVPHighLevelArchitecture.md`, which provides:
- Layered architecture design with clear separation of concerns
- Detailed implementation structure for all MVP features
- Scalability considerations for future expansions
- Testing strategy and performance optimization approaches

## Rationale for MVP Feature Selection

### Included Features
1. **Basic Character System**: Provides player investment while being manageable in scope
2. **Single Town Hub**: Focuses development resources while providing essential gameplay loop
3. **Limited Companion System**: Demonstrates social features without complex AI requirements
4. **Core Combat**: Establishes fundamental gameplay mechanics
5. **Simple Crafting**: Adds depth without overwhelming complexity

### Features Deferred for Future Releases
1. **Advanced Character Customization**: While valuable, not essential for core gameplay
2. **Multiple Towns**: Significant content creation burden
3. **Complex Faction System**: Requires extensive testing and balancing
4. **Advanced Weather Effects**: Nice-to-have but not core to gameplay
5. **Advanced Crafting**: Can be expanded based on player feedback
