# Performance Benchmarking Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the strategy and methodology for performance benchmarking in the game project. It provides standardized approaches to measuring, tracking, and optimizing performance across different devices and platforms.

## Specific Metrics to Track

### Frame Rate Performance
- **Target FPS**: 60 FPS minimum on desktop, 30 FPS minimum on mobile devices
- **Measurement Points**:
  - Scene initialization
  - During heavy gameplay (combat, particle effects)
  - During scene transitions
  - With maximum entities on screen
- **Reporting Format**: Min/Max/Average FPS, frame time distribution

### Memory Usage
- **Heap Allocation**: Track JS heap usage over time
- **DOM Elements**: Monitor count and size
- **Texture Memory**: Monitor GPU memory usage for textures
- **Asset Memory**: Track loaded asset sizes and counts

### Asset Loading Times
- **Initial Load Time**: Time to first interactive frame
- **Level Load Time**: Time to load each game level/scene
- **Asset Loading Performance**: Loading time by asset type (textures, audio, JSON)
- **Caching Effectiveness**: Improvement with various caching strategies

### Network Performance
- **Payload Sizes**: Size of network requests
- **Request Counts**: Number of resource requests
- **Response Times**: Time from request to response completion
- **Compression Effectiveness**: Size reduction from compression

### Input Latency
- **Input to Visual Response Time**: Time from user input to visible change
- **Event Processing Time**: Time to process input events

## Tools for Measurement

### Browser DevTools
- **Chrome Performance Panel**: For detailed frame timing and memory profiling
- **Memory Panel**: For heap snapshots and memory leak detection
- **Network Panel**: For network request timing and size analysis

### Phaser-Specific Tools
- Custom performance monitor using Phaser's built-in timing:
  ```typescript
  class PhaserPerformanceMonitor {
    private metrics: {
      fps: number[];
      frameTime: number[];
      heapSize: number[];
      entityCount: number[];
      drawCalls: number[];
      timestamp: number;
    };
    
    // Methods for capturing and reporting metrics
  }
  ```

### Custom Performance Utilities
- **FPS Counter**: Overlay display during development/testing
- **Memory Usage Logger**: Periodic logging of memory metrics
- **Scene Transition Timer**: Measuring load times between scenes
- **Asset Loading Reporter**: Detailed loading time breakdowns

### Automation Tools
- **Lighthouse CI**: For automated performance testing in CI pipeline
- **WebPageTest**: For cross-browser performance testing
- **Custom Test Harness**: Automated benchmark test runner

## Performance Baselines for Different Devices

### Device Categories
1. **High-End Desktop**
   - Modern desktop/laptop with dedicated GPU
   - Chrome/Firefox/Safari latest versions
   - Expected Performance: 60+ FPS constant, <100ms scene load

2. **Mid-Range Desktop/Laptop**
   - Integrated GPU systems
   - Chrome/Firefox/Safari latest versions
   - Expected Performance: 60 FPS with occasional dips, <200ms scene load

3. **High-End Mobile**
   - Latest iPhone/flagship Android
   - Mobile Chrome/Safari
   - Expected Performance: 60 FPS with occasional dips, <300ms scene load

4. **Mid-Range Mobile**
   - 2-3 year old mobile devices
   - Mobile Chrome/Safari
   - Expected Performance: 30+ FPS, <500ms scene load

5. **Low-End Mobile**
   - Budget/older devices
   - Mobile Chrome/Safari
   - Expected Performance: 30 FPS target, acceptable dips to 20 FPS, <1s scene load

### Baseline Establishment Methodology
1. Run standardized test scenes on each device category
2. Record metrics for key performance indicators
3. Set minimum acceptable thresholds based on collected data
4. Document baseline results in performance tracking spreadsheet
5. Update baselines with each major release

## Process for Regular Performance Testing

### Development Testing
- **Frequency**: Daily during active development
- **Scope**: Critical scenes and features under development
- **Methodology**: Manual testing with performance overlay
- **Reporting**: Quick feedback to development team

### Milestone Testing
- **Frequency**: At each sprint milestone
- **Scope**: Full game test across all device categories
- **Methodology**: Automated test suite + manual verification
- **Reporting**: Comprehensive report with comparison to baselines

### Release Testing
- **Frequency**: Before each release
- **Scope**: Complete performance audit across all metrics
- **Methodology**: Automated + manual testing on actual devices
- **Reporting**: Detailed performance report with recommendations

### Continuous Integration
- Automated performance testing on each significant PR
- Fail builds that degrade performance beyond thresholds
- Generate performance trend reports over time

## Performance Regression Protocol
1. **Detection**: Identify performance regression through testing
2. **Isolation**: Determine which change caused the regression
3. **Analysis**: Profile the impacted area to identify specific causes
4. **Remediation**: Fix the performance issue
5. **Verification**: Confirm the fix restores performance to baseline
6. **Documentation**: Record the issue and solution for future reference

## Performance Optimization Guidelines

### Rendering Optimization
- Minimize draw calls through batching
- Use texture atlases for related sprites
- Implement proper object pooling
- Implement visibility culling for off-screen objects

### Script Optimization
- Avoid garbage collection during gameplay
- Optimize update loops to minimize CPU usage
- Use object pooling for frequently created/destroyed objects
- Profile and optimize hot code paths

### Asset Optimization
- Properly compress textures based on device capabilities
- Implement progressive loading for large assets
- Implement asset streaming for open-world areas
- Use audio compression appropriate for target devices

## Performance Dashboard
- Real-time performance monitoring during development
- Historical performance tracking across builds
- Device-specific performance reports
- Trend analysis and regression detection

## Success Criteria
- All games maintain target FPS on specified device categories
- Asset loading completes within defined thresholds
- Memory usage remains within defined limits
- Input latency meets responsive gameplay requirements

## Conclusion
This performance benchmarking plan provides a comprehensive framework for ensuring optimal game performance across all target platforms. By following these guidelines and regularly measuring against established baselines, the development team can deliver a smooth and responsive gaming experience to all users.
