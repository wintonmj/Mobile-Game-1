# Service Migration and Versioning Guide

## Overview
This document outlines the procedures and best practices for managing service migrations, versioning, and upgrades within our game system. It provides guidelines for maintaining backward compatibility and ensuring smooth service transitions.

## Service Upgrade Procedures

### Pre-Upgrade Checklist
- Backup current service state and configurations
- Review dependent services and potential impact
- Schedule upgrade during low-traffic periods
- Prepare rollback plan
- Update documentation

### Upgrade Process
1. **Preparation Phase**
   - Version compatibility verification
   - Database migration scripts preparation
   - Service dependency updates
   - Test environment validation

2. **Implementation Phase**
   - Deploy database migrations
   - Update service configurations
   - Deploy new service version
   - Run health checks
   - Verify service integrations

3. **Validation Phase**
   - Monitor service metrics
   - Validate data consistency
   - Check client compatibility
   - Verify API responses

4. **Rollback Procedures**
   - Criteria for rollback decisions
   - Step-by-step rollback process
   - Data recovery procedures
   - Client notification protocol

## Backward Compatibility Requirements

### API Versioning
- Use semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- Maintain support for N-1 version
- Document breaking changes
- Provide migration paths for deprecated features

### Data Schema Evolution
- Use schema versioning
- Support data migration between versions
- Maintain backward compatibility for at least one major version
- Document schema changes and migration procedures

### Client Compatibility
- Support graceful degradation
- Implement feature detection
- Provide fallback mechanisms
- Document minimum client version requirements

## Version Management Strategy

### Versioning Rules
1. **Major Version (X.y.z)**
   - Breaking changes
   - Incompatible API changes
   - Major feature additions

2. **Minor Version (x.Y.z)**
   - Backward-compatible feature additions
   - Deprecation notices
   - Substantial improvements

3. **Patch Version (x.y.Z)**
   - Bug fixes
   - Performance improvements
   - Minor updates

### Release Process
1. **Version Planning**
   - Feature roadmap alignment
   - Breaking change assessment
   - Dependency update planning

2. **Version Control**
   - Branch management
   - Tag naming conventions
   - Release candidate process

3. **Documentation Requirements**
   - Changelog maintenance
   - API documentation updates
   - Migration guide updates
   - Release notes preparation

### Long-term Support (LTS)
- LTS version selection criteria
- Support duration for each version type
- Security update policy
- End-of-life procedures

## Best Practices

### Service Design
- Design for backward compatibility
- Implement feature toggles
- Use dependency injection
- Follow SOLID principles

### Testing Requirements
- Version compatibility tests
- Integration tests across versions
- Performance regression tests
- Migration script validation

### Monitoring and Metrics
- Version adoption tracking
- Error rate monitoring
- Performance metrics
- Client version distribution
