# Technical Stack Proposals

## Overview
This document outlines and analyzes different technical stack options for our browser-based single-player RPG. The analysis is based on the core game features detailed in [HighLevelDesign.md](../design/HighLevelDesign.md), which includes:
- Character Creation & Progression (D&D-inspired system)
- World Design (4 major towns, rich overworld, dungeon systems)
- NPC Systems (dynamic schedules, companions, factions)
- Quest System (branching storylines, multiple resolution paths)
- Combat & Interaction Systems
- Resource & Crafting Systems

Each stack is evaluated based on its ability to support these core RPG features, development efficiency, and long-term maintainability.
