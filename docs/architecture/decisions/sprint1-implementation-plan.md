# Sprint 1: Project Foundation Implementation Plan

## Document Purpose
This document details the specific implementation tasks, technical decisions, and deliverables for Sprint 1 of the browser-based RPG project. It serves as a comprehensive guide for the development team to establish the foundational project structure and core technical infrastructure necessary for future feature development.

## Problem Statement
Our browser-based RPG project requires a solid technical foundation before feature development can begin. Specifically, we need to address:

1. **Technical Stack Integration** - We need to validate and configure Phaser.js with Vite and TypeScript
2. **Core Architecture Definition** - We need to establish service patterns, event systems, and scene management
3. **Development Environment** - We need a consistent, efficient development workflow for the team
4. **Technical Quality Assurance** - We need testing strategies and code quality standards from the start

## Testing Strategy

For a comprehensive testing approach, refer to the [testing-strategy.md](../../testing/jest-testing-strategy.md) document. The testing strategy covers:

- Unit testing of individual components and services
- Integration testing for component interactions
- Visual testing for UI and rendering
- Performance testing for game execution
- Phaser.js-specific testing approaches and considerations

All testing activities for Sprint 1 should follow the guidelines established in this document.

## Test-Driven Development Approach

### 1. Service Layer Testing

We'll implement the core services using TDD with these test categories:

1. **ServiceRegistry Tests**
   - Service registration/retrieval functionality
   - Singleton pattern implementation
   - Error handling for missing or duplicate services
   - Service lifecycle management (init/destroy)

2. **EventBus Tests**
   - Event subscription and publishing
   - Event payload type safety
   - Event throttling/debouncing
   - Scoped events (game-wide vs scene-specific)

3. **Configuration System Tests**
   - Configuration loading and validation
   - Environment-specific overrides
   - Type safety for configuration objects
   - Default value handling

### 2. Game Loop Testing

We'll implement the game loop using TDD with these test categories:

1. **Update Cycle Tests**
   - Fixed update timing
   - Variable update timing
   - Performance monitoring
   - State synchronization

2. **Scene Management Tests**
   - Scene transitions
   - Scene initialization/destruction
   - Asset loading/unloading
   - Service scoping within scenes

## Key Architectural Considerations

Before beginning implementation, consider these important architectural elements:

### Phaser Integration
- **Game vs Scene Structure**: Carefully design how your custom architecture interacts with Phaser's own scene and game lifecycle. Phaser has its own event system and update loop, which must be properly integrated with your ServiceRegistry and EventBus.
- **Rendering Pipeline**: Understand Phaser's WebGL/Canvas rendering pipeline before implementing custom rendering services.
- **Physics Integration**: If you plan to use Phaser's physics systems, ensure your architecture doesn't conflict with their update methods.
- **Input Management**: Plan how to handle cross-platform input (touch, mouse, keyboard) in a consistent way while leveraging Phaser's input systems.
- **Game Object Lifecycle**: Ensure your entity system works harmoniously with Phaser's game object lifecycle to prevent memory leaks.

### Asset Management
- **Asset Loading Strategy**: Design your asset loading strategy early - Phaser has specific approaches to preloading assets within scenes.
- **Asset Optimization**: Consider implementing asset atlases and sprite sheets from the beginning to avoid refactoring later.
- **Memory Management**: Plan for asset disposal and garbage collection, especially for scene transitions.
- **Save System Integration**: Design how assets will interact with the save system including asset state persistence, versioning, and change tracking.
- **Storage Strategy**: Plan for both LocalStorage (small data) and IndexedDB (larger assets/cache) usage with appropriate fallbacks.
- **Asset References**: Implement a reference-based system for static assets to minimize save data size while preserving game state.
- **Asset Version Compatibility**: Create a versioning system for assets to handle save compatibility across game updates.

### Service Architecture
- **Service Dependencies**: The ServiceRegistry should handle dependency resolution between services - ensure circular dependencies are prevented.
- **Service Lifecycle**: Services should have clear initialization sequences, especially those dependent on Phaser systems being ready.
- **State Isolation**: Design services to maintain clean state boundaries to avoid leaking state between game sessions.
- **Service Communication**: Define clear patterns for how services should communicate with each other - direct calls vs events.
- **Error Handling**: Create consistent error handling strategies for service failures that won't crash the entire game.

### Performance Considerations
- **Event Throttling**: Implement event throttling early for frequent events like input or collision detection.
- **Batched Updates**: Consider batching updates for related entities to minimize performance impact.
- **Memory Profiling**: Set up basic memory profiling tools during development to identify leaks early.
- **Render Optimization**: Plan for techniques like object culling, LOD (Level of Detail), and sprite batching.
- **State Synchronization**: Design efficient approaches for synchronizing game state with rendering and physics.

### Technical Debt Management
- **Code Duplication**: Establish patterns early to avoid repeated code and ensure consistency.
- **Refactoring Strategy**: Define criteria for when to refactor vs. when to accumulate technical debt.
- **Documentation Requirements**: Set standards for documenting complex systems and architectural decisions.
- **Test Coverage Goals**: Define which areas require high test coverage vs. areas where manual testing is sufficient.
- **Performance Budgets**: Establish performance metrics and budgets for critical game systems.

These considerations should help avoid major architectural refactoring in future sprints.
