## 1. Core Architecture Overview

This document provides the technical architecture to implement the features and requirements specified in `docs/design/MVPDesign.md`. The architecture is designed to support all MVP features while maintaining the scalability needed for the future development roadmap outlined in the MVP Design.

The architecture follows the structure defined in [ProjectStructure.md](../../ProjectStructure.md), with specific adaptations to support the MVP features outlined in the MVP Design Document. We'll use a layered architecture with these primary components:

### 1.1 Core Layers
Following the structure from [ProjectStructure.md](../../ProjectStructure.md):
```
src/
├── services/      # Core Game Services Layer
├── scenes/        # Game Scene Layer (View)
├── entities/      # Game Entity Layer (Model)
├── controllers/   # Game Logic Layer (Controller)
└── events/        # Event Communication Layer
```

## 2. MVP-Specific Implementation

### 2.1 Character System Implementation
Following the service structure from [ProjectStructure.md](../../ProjectStructure.md):
```

```

### 2.2 World Design Implementation
Following the service structure from [ProjectStructure.md](../../ProjectStructure.md):
```
src/
├── services/
│   ├── world/             # World-related services
│   │   ├── time/          # Time management

```

### 2.3 Core Systems Implementation
Following the service structure from [ProjectStructure.md](../../ProjectStructure.md):
```
src/
├── services/

    ├── quest/           # Quest events
    └── world/           # World events
```

## 3. Service Layer Design

### 3.1 Core Services
```
src/services/
├── registry.ts           # Service registry pattern
├── core/
│   ├── game.service.ts   # Game state management
│   ├── save.service.ts   # Save/load functionality
│   ├── audio.service.ts  # Sound management
│   └── input.service.ts  # Input handling
└── world/
    ├── time.service.ts   # Day/night cycle
    ├── weather.service.ts # Weather system
    └── spawn.service.ts   # Resource/enemy spawning
```

## 4. Data Flow Architecture

```
[User Input] → [Input Service] → [Event Bus] → [Controllers] → [Entities]
                                                            ↓
[Renderer] ← [Scene Manager] ← [Game State] ← [Services] ← [State Updates]
```

## 5. Key Technical Considerations

### 5.1 Performance Optimization
```
src/
├── config/
│   ├── assets.config.ts    # Asset loading configuration
│   └── performance.config.ts # Performance settings
└── services/
    └── core/
        └── loader.service.ts # Optimized asset loading
```

### 5.2 State Management
```
src/
├── models/
│   ├── state/
│   │   ├── game.state.ts    # Core game state
│   │   ├── player.state.ts  # Player state
│   │   └── world.state.ts   # World state
└── services/
    └── state/
        └── persistence.service.ts # State persistence
```

For detailed implementation of state management in the game loop, see [game-loop-state.md](../../implementation/game-loop-state.md). The state management system:

1. **Core Features**:
   - Scene state synchronization
   - Entity state updates
   - Input processing order
   - Event dispatch timing

2. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Batched state updates
   - Priority-based scheduling
   - State change validation
   - Efficient state diffing

3. **Integration Points**:
   - Game loop coordination
   - Service layer integration
   - Event system synchronization
   - Performance monitoring hooks

### 5.3 Asset-Save System Integration
```
src/
├── services/
│   ├── core/
│   │   ├── save.service.ts     # Enhanced with asset state tracking
│   │   └── asset.service.ts    # Asset management with save integration
│   └── storage/
│       ├── local-storage.service.ts  # Primary storage for small save data
│       └── indexed-db.service.ts     # Storage for larger asset references
└── utils/
    └── asset/
        ├── reference.util.ts   # Asset reference system for save optimization
        ├── delta.util.ts       # Delta encoding for asset changes
        └── version.util.ts     # Asset version compatibility handling
```

The asset-save integration architecture implements:

1. **Storage Strategy**:
   - LocalStorage for critical game state and references
   - IndexedDB for larger asset caches and modified asset states
   - Fallback mechanisms when storage limits are reached

2. **Asset Reference System**:
   - References static assets by ID rather than duplicating data
   - Stores only delta changes for modified world objects
   - Maintains checksums for data integrity validation

3. **Version Compatibility**:
   - Tracks asset versions in save data
   - Provides migration paths for saves with outdated assets
   - Handles missing or updated assets gracefully

## 6. Testing Strategy

```
tests/
├── unit/
│   ├── services/     # Service tests
│   ├── entities/     # Entity tests
│   └── controllers/  # Controller tests
└── integration/
    ├── combat/       # Combat system tests
    ├── quests/       # Quest system tests
    └── world/        # World interaction tests
```

## 7. Scalability Considerations

The architecture is designed to support the MVP features while maintaining clear paths for expansion in future releases:

1. **Character System Expansion**
   - Modular class system for easy addition of new classes
   - Extensible stat system for future attributes

2. **World Expansion**
   - Scene management system ready for additional areas
   - Modular weather and time systems

3. **Content Scaling**
   - Quest system designed for easy content addition
   - NPC system ready for expanded interactions

This architecture aligns with both the MVP Design Document's focus on essential features and the Project Structure's guidelines for organized, maintainable code. It provides a solid foundation for the initial release while maintaining code quality and scalability.

The design follows the Phase 1 structure from the Project Structure document while incorporating the specific features needed for the MVP, ensuring we can deliver the core gameplay experience efficiently while maintaining code quality and scalability.
