# Service Initialization Sequence Documentation

## Overview
This document details the service initialization sequence, dependency resolution order, and error recovery paths in our game architecture. The sequence diagrams and documentation provided here serve as the definitive reference for understanding how services are initialized and managed throughout the application lifecycle.

## Service Initialization Sequence

### Core Service Bootstrap Sequence
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Game as GameInstance
    participant Registry as ServiceRegistry
    participant Core as CoreServices
    participant Event as EventBus
    
    Game->>Registry: initialize()
    Registry->>Core: bootstrapCoreServices()
    Core->>Event: initializeEventBus()
    Event-->>Core: eventBusReady
    Core->>Registry: registerCoreServices()
    Registry-->>Game: coreServicesReady
    
    Note over Game,Registry: Core services include EventBus, AudioService, InputService
```

### Dependency Resolution Order
```mermaid

    participant Registry as ServiceRegistry
    participant Service as GameService
    participant Deps as Dependencies
    
    Registry->>Service: initializeService()
    Service->>Registry: requestDependencies()
    Registry->>Deps: resolveDependencies()
    Deps-->>Registry: dependenciesResolved
    Registry->>Service: injectDependencies()
    Service-->>Registry: serviceReady
    
    Note over Registry,Service: Services are initialized in dependency order
```

### Error Recovery Flow
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Game as GameInstance
    participant Service as FailingService
    participant Recovery as ErrorRecovery
    participant Event as EventBus
    
    Service->>Event: serviceFailure
    Event->>Recovery: initiateRecovery
    Recovery->>Service: attemptRecovery
    alt Recovery Successful
        Service-->>Game: serviceRestored
    else Recovery Failed
        Recovery->>Game: initiateGracefulDegradation
        Game->>Event: serviceUnavailable
    end
```

## Initialization Process Details

### 1. Core Service Bootstrap
1. Game instance triggers ServiceRegistry initialization
2. ServiceRegistry bootstraps core services in the following order:
   - EventBus
   - ConfigurationService
   - LoggingService
   - AudioService
   - InputService
3. Each core service registers with the ServiceRegistry
4. ServiceRegistry validates core service initialization

### 2. Dependency Resolution
1. ServiceRegistry maintains a dependency graph
2. Services declare their dependencies through metadata
3. Resolution occurs in topological order
4. Circular dependencies are detected and prevented
5. Optional dependencies are handled gracefully

### 3. Error Recovery Strategies
1. Immediate retry for transient failures
2. Graceful degradation for persistent failures
3. Service replacement for critical failures
4. State preservation during recovery
5. Event notification for service status changes

## Service State Management

### Service Lifecycle States
- UNINITIALIZED
- INITIALIZING
- READY
- ERROR
- RECOVERING
- DEGRADED
- SHUTDOWN

### State Transitions
```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> UNINITIALIZED
    UNINITIALIZED --> INITIALIZING
    INITIALIZING --> READY
    INITIALIZING --> ERROR
    ERROR --> RECOVERING
    RECOVERING --> READY
    RECOVERING --> DEGRADED
    DEGRADED --> RECOVERING
    READY --> SHUTDOWN
    SHUTDOWN --> [*]
```

## Testing Considerations

### Initialization Testing
1. Verify correct initialization order
2. Test dependency resolution
3. Validate error recovery paths
4. Check state transitions
5. Test service communication post-initialization

### Integration Testing
1. Verify service interactions
2. Test cross-service dependencies
3. Validate event propagation
4. Check error handling across services
5. Test system-wide state consistency

## Best Practices

### Service Implementation
1. Declare dependencies explicitly
2. Implement proper error handling
3. Follow the initialization lifecycle
4. Use typed events for communication
5. Maintain service independence

### Error Handling
1. Implement graceful degradation
2. Preserve system stability
3. Log meaningful error messages
4. Provide recovery mechanisms
5. Maintain service boundaries
