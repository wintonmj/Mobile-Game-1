# Project Structure Documentation Alignment

## Overview
This document outlines the alignment analysis and required changes between the following documents:
1. `docs/ProjectStructure.md`
2. `docs/architecture/decisions/sprint1-implementation-plan.md`
3. `docs/architecture/patterns/mvp-high-level-architecture.md`

## Current State Analysis

### 1. Directory Structure Alignment

#### ProjectStructure.md vs sprint1-implementation-plan.md
- **Inconsistencies Found**:
  1. Sprint 1 plan shows a simplified structure with `core/` directory at root level, while ProjectStructure.md has services at root
  2. Sprint 1 plan's service structure is flatter than ProjectStructure.md's detailed hierarchy
  3. Different approaches to config organization between documents

#### ProjectStructure.md vs mvp-high-level-architecture.md
- **Inconsistencies Found**:
  1. MVP architecture shows specific MVP feature directories not reflected in ProjectStructure.md
  2. Different service organization patterns between documents
  3. Testing structure variations

### 2. Service Layer Organization

#### Common Patterns
- All documents agree on:
  1. Service Registry pattern usage
  2. Event-driven architecture
  3. Core service categories

#### Differences to Resolve
1. Service Hierarchy:
   - ProjectStructure.md has detailed service categorization
   - Sprint 1 plan has simplified service structure
   - MVP architecture has feature-specific service organization

2. Service Implementation:
   - Different approaches to service initialization
   - Varying patterns for service dependencies
   - Inconsistent service naming conventions

### 3. Documentation Cross-References

#### Missing Cross-References
1. ProjectStructure.md needs to reference:
   - Sprint 1 implementation details
   - MVP architecture patterns
   - Service organization guidelines

2. Sprint 1 plan needs to reference:
   - Project structure guidelines for implementation
   - Detailed service organization patterns

3. MVP architecture needs to reference:
   - Specific project structure sections for implementation
   - Sprint 1 technical decisions

## Required Changes

### 1. ProjectStructure.md Updates
1. Add MVP Feature Support:
   ```
   src/
   ├── services/
   │   ├── character/          # Character system services
   │   │   ├── progression/    # Level-based advancement
   │   │   └── customization/  # Appearance customization
   │   ├── world/             # World-related services
   │   │   ├── time/          # Day/night cycle
   │   │   └── weather/       # Weather system
   │   └── core/              # Core game services
   ```

2. Update Service Organization:
   - Align with MVP architecture service patterns
   - Include feature-specific service directories
   - Document service hierarchy standards

3. Add Cross-References:
   - Link to sprint1-implementation-plan.md for implementation details
   - Reference MVP architecture for feature organization
   - Include service pattern documentation

### 2. Sprint 1 Plan Updates
1. Align Directory Structure:
   - Update to match ProjectStructure.md hierarchy
   - Include MVP feature directories
   - Document transition from simple to full structure

2. Enhance Service Documentation:
   - Add detailed service organization guidelines
   - Include service dependency patterns
   - Document service naming conventions

3. Add Cross-References:
   - Link to ProjectStructure.md for directory standards
   - Reference MVP architecture for feature implementation
   - Include service pattern documentation

### 3. MVP Architecture Updates
1. Align with Project Structure:
   - Update directory examples to match ProjectStructure.md
   - Include standard service hierarchy
   - Document feature-specific adaptations

2. Enhance Implementation Details:
   - Add service organization guidelines
   - Include dependency management patterns
   - Document feature integration approaches

3. Add Cross-References:
   - Link to ProjectStructure.md for base structure
   - Reference Sprint 1 plan for implementation details
   - Include service pattern documentation

## Next Steps

1. Update ProjectStructure.md:
   - Add MVP feature support
   - Align service organization
   - Add cross-references

2. Update Sprint 1 Plan:
   - Align directory structure
   - Enhance service documentation
   - Add cross-references

3. Update MVP Architecture:
   - Align with project structure
   - Enhance implementation details
   - Add cross-references

4. Review and Validate:
   - Ensure all changes maintain consistency
   - Verify cross-references are accurate
   - Confirm alignment with implementation needs

## Success Criteria

1. Directory Structure:
   - Consistent hierarchy across all documents
   - Clear organization patterns
   - Proper feature support

2. Service Organization:
   - Unified service patterns
   - Clear dependency management
   - Consistent naming conventions

3. Documentation:
   - Complete cross-references
   - Clear implementation guidelines
   - Accurate feature documentation
