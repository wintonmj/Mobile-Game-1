# Timer-Related Test Failures Analysis

## Overview
This document analyzes the failing tests in the AssetService cache policy enforcement suite. All failures are related to timer handling and test timeouts.

## Common Error Pattern
All tests are failing with the same error:
```
Exceeded timeout of 10000 ms for a test
```

This indicates that the tests are taking longer than Jest's configured timeout of 10 seconds to complete.

## Individual Test Analysis

### 1. "should keep persistent assets in cache"
**What it's testing:**
- Verifies that assets marked as PERSISTENT remain in cache even after long periods
- Tests the CachePolicy.PERSISTENT behavior

**Error:**
```
Exceeded timeout of 10000 ms for a test
```

**Problem:**
- The test is trying to wait for `CACHE_TIMEOUT * 2` (10 seconds)
- Jest's default timeout is 5 seconds
- The test is not properly configured to handle long-running timer operations

**Test Command:**
```bash
npm test -- src/__tests__/services/AssetService.test.ts --testNamePattern="should keep persistent assets in cache"
```

### 2. "should remove temporary assets after 5 seconds of inactivity"
**What it's testing:**
- Verifies that assets marked as TEMPORARY are removed from cache after 5 seconds of inactivity
- Tests the CachePolicy.TEMPORARY behavior

**Error:**
```
Exceeded timeout of 10000 ms for a test
```

**Problem:**
- The test is waiting for `CACHE_TIMEOUT + BUFFER_TIME` (6 seconds)
- The timer advances are not properly coordinated with Jest's timer system
- Microtask queue processing is not properly handled

**Test Command:**
```bash
npm test -- src/__tests__/services/AssetService.test.ts --testNamePattern="should remove temporary assets after 5 seconds of inactivity"
```

### 3. "should keep temporary assets if used within 5 seconds"
**What it's testing:**
- Verifies that temporary assets stay in cache if they're used within the 5-second window
- Tests the cache refresh behavior for temporary assets

**Error:**
```
Exceeded timeout of 10000 ms for a test
```

**Problem:**
- Multiple timer advances are causing the test to exceed the timeout
- The test is not properly handling the async nature of the cache refresh operation

**Test Command:**
```bash
npm test -- src/__tests__/services/AssetService.test.ts --testNamePattern="should keep temporary assets if used within 5 seconds"
```

### 4. "should handle manual cache policy correctly"
**What it's testing:**
- Verifies that assets marked as MANUAL stay in cache until explicitly removed
- Tests the CachePolicy.MANUAL behavior

**Error:**
```
Exceeded timeout of 10000 ms for a test
```

**Problem:**
- The test is performing multiple timer advances without proper cleanup
- The manual cache removal operation is not properly coordinated with timer advances

**Test Command:**
```bash
npm test -- src/__tests__/services/AssetService.test.ts --testNamePattern="should handle manual cache policy correctly"
```

### 5. "should enforce cache policies across different asset types"
**What it's testing:**
- Verifies that cache policies work consistently across different asset types (images, audio)
- Tests cache policy enforcement for multiple asset types simultaneously

**Error:**
```
Exceeded timeout of 10000 ms for a test
```

**Problem:**
- Multiple asset loading operations combined with timer advances are causing timeouts
- The test is not properly handling parallel asset loading operations

**Test Command:**
```bash
npm test -- src/__tests__/services/AssetService.test.ts --testNamePattern="should enforce cache policies across different asset types"
```

## Root Causes

1. **Timer Configuration Issues:**
   - Jest's timer mocking is not properly configured
   - Timer advances are too large and not properly coordinated
   - Microtask queue processing is not handled correctly

2. **Test Timeout Issues:**
   - Jest's default timeout (5 seconds) is too short for these tests
   - Tests are not properly configured with appropriate timeouts
   - Timer advances are not properly broken down into smaller increments

3. **Async Operation Handling:**
   - Asset loading operations are not properly coordinated with timer advances
   - Promise resolution is not properly handled
   - Microtask queue processing is not properly managed

## Proposed Solutions

1. **Timer Configuration:**
   - Use Jest's modern timer implementation
   - Configure proper timer precision
   - Handle microtask queue properly

2. **Test Timeouts:**
   - Increase Jest timeout for these specific tests
   - Break down long timer advances into smaller increments
   - Add proper cleanup between timer operations

3. **Async Handling:**
   - Properly coordinate asset loading with timer advances
   - Handle promise resolution correctly
   - Manage microtask queue processing

## Running Tests
To run all cache policy tests:
```bash
npm test -- src/__tests__/services/AssetService.test.ts --testNamePattern="Cache Policy Enforcement"
```

To run a specific test with increased timeout:
```bash
npm test -- src/__tests__/services/AssetService.test.ts --testNamePattern="test name" --testTimeout=15000
