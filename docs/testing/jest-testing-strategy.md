## Strategic Testing Objectives

Our testing strategy aims to achieve these key objectives:

1. **Validate core gameplay features** against design requirements
2. **Ensure system stability** across different environments
3. **Maintain performance standards** for smooth gameplay
4. **Support rapid iteration** without sacrificing quality
5. **Prevent regression** as new features are added

## Test Categories and Priorities

### High Priority: Core Game Systems
- **Service Registry and Dependency Management**
- **Event System**
- **State Management**
- **Game Loop and Performance-Critical Code**

### Medium Priority: Game Features
- **Combat System**
- **Character Progression**
- **Item and Inventory Management**

### Lower Priority: UI and Polish Features
- **Visual Effects**
- **UI Animation**

## Test Coverage Requirements

Minimum coverage targets:

- Overall project: 80% line coverage
- Core services: 90% line coverage
- Entity models: 85% line coverage
- Controller logic: 80% line coverage
- UI components: 70% line coverage

## Implementation Guidelines

### Jest Configuration

```javascript
// jest.config.js
module.exports = {
  preset: 'ts-jest',
  testEnvironment: 'jsdom',
  setupFiles: ['jest-canvas-mock'],
  moduleNameMapper: {
    '\\.(jpg|jpeg|png|gif|webp|svg)$': '<rootDir>/tests/helpers/fileMock.js',
    '\\.(css|less|scss)$': '<rootDir>/tests/helpers/styleMock.js'
  },
  collectCoverageFrom: [
    'src/**/*.{ts,tsx}',
    '!src/**/*.d.ts'
  ],
  coverageThreshold: {
    global: {
      statements: 80,
      branches: 70,
      functions: 80,
      lines: 80
    }
  }
};
```

### File Naming Conventions
- Test files: `[name].test.ts` or `[name].spec.ts`
- Test helpers: `[purpose].helper.ts`
- Mock factories: `[entity].mock.ts`

### Documentation Standards
- Use JSDoc comments for test suites and complex test cases
- Document test setup requirements
- Explain complex test scenarios
- Document test data generation
- Use descriptive variable names

## Phaser.js Testing Considerations

1. **Rendering Pipeline Testing**
   - Use Jest's JSDOM environment
   - Mock canvas operations
   - Implement visual regression testing

2. **Input Handling Testing**
   - Mock input events
   - Test input state management
   - Validate event propagation

3. **Asset Loading Testing**
   - Mock asset loading processes
   - Test error handling
   - Validate asset management

4. **Performance Testing**
   - Measure frame rates
   - Monitor memory usage
   - Test asset loading times

## Quality Assurance Process

### Development Workflow
1. **Planning Phase**
   - Define testable requirements
   - Establish acceptance criteria
   - Identify critical test scenarios

2. **Development Phase**
   - Write tests before implementation (TDD when applicable)
   - Conduct regular integration testing
   - Perform automated testing in PRs

3. **Release Phase**
   - Run comprehensive test suite
   - Conduct performance testing
   - Validate against acceptance criteria

4. **Maintenance Phase**
   - Update tests for bug fixes
   - Expand test coverage
   - Refactor tests alongside code

## Testing Best Practices

### General Guidelines
1. Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
2. Keep tests independent and isolated
3. Use meaningful test descriptions
4. Avoid test interdependencies
5. Clean up resources after tests

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid
1. Testing implementation details
2. Sharing state between tests
3. Complex test setup
4. Brittle assertions
5. Incomplete error testing
