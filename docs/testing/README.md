# Testing Documentation

## Overview
This directory contains all testing-related documentation, configuration, and utilities for the game project. Our testing strategy follows a comprehensive approach that includes unit tests, integration tests, performance tests, and visual regression tests.

## Key Documents
- [Jest Testing Strategy](jest-testing-strategy.md) - Detailed Jest configuration and testing patterns
- [Test Implementation Details](test-implementation-details.md) - Specific patterns and best practices
- [Coverage Requirements](coverage-requirements.md) - Coverage thresholds and requirements

## Testing Standards
Our testing follows these key principles:
1. **Strong Type Safety**: Utilizing TypeScript for type-safe tests
2. **Component Isolation**: Testing components in isolation with proper mocking
3. **State Management**: Comprehensive testing of state machines and transitions
4. **Event Systems**: Thorough testing of event emissions and handling
5. **Performance**: Regular benchmarking of critical systems
6. **Visual Consistency**: Regression testing for UI components

## Coverage Requirements
- Overall Project: 80% line coverage
- Core Services: 90% coverage
- Entity Models: 85% coverage
- Controller Logic: 80% coverage
- UI Components: 70% coverage

## Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run unit tests only
npm run test:unit

# Run integration tests
npm run test:integration

# Run with coverage report
npm run test:coverage

# Run visual regression tests
npm run test:visual
```

## Contributing
1. Follow the test naming convention: `*.test.ts` or `*.spec.ts`
2. Group related tests using describe blocks
3. Use the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
4. Write both positive and negative test cases
5. Keep tests independent and isolated
6. Document complex test scenarios
7. Use appropriate mocking strategies

## Best Practices
- Write tests alongside implementation
- Focus on behavior, not implementation details
- Use descriptive test names
- Create reusable test factories and helpers
- Mock external dependencies consistently
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Maintain test code quality
- Review coverage reports regularly
