# Test Coverage Requirements

## Overview
This document outlines the test coverage requirements for different parts of the codebase. Coverage requirements are enforced through Jest configuration and are checked during the CI/CD pipeline.

## Coverage Thresholds

### Overall Project Requirements
- **Global Minimum**: 80% line coverage
- **Statements**: 80%
- **Branches**: 75%
- **Functions**: 80%
- **Lines**: 80%

### Component-Specific Requirements

#### Core Services (90% coverage)
- **Game State Service**: 95%
- **Event Bus Service**: 95%
- **Audio Service**: 90%
- **Input Service**: 90%
- **Scene Management Service**: 90%
- **Asset Loading Service**: 90%

#### Entity Models (85% coverage)
- **Player Entity**: 90%
- **Enemy Entities**: 85%
- **Item Entities**: 85%
- **Environment Entities**: 80%
- **Projectile Entities**: 85%

#### Controller Logic (80% coverage)
- **Player Controller**: 85%
- **Enemy AI Controllers**: 80%
- **Game Flow Controller**: 85%
- **UI Controllers**: 80%
- **Input Controllers**: 85%

#### UI Components (70% coverage)
- **HUD Components**: 75%
- **Menu Components**: 70%
- **Dialog Components**: 70%
- **Inventory UI**: 70%
- **Status Effects UI**: 70%

## Critical Paths
The following areas require 100% coverage due to their critical nature:
- Authentication flows
- Save/Load game functionality
- Core game state transitions
- Critical game mechanics
- Data persistence operations

## Coverage Enforcement

### Jest Configuration
```javascript
module.exports = {
  coverageThreshold: {
    global: {
      branches: 75,
      functions: 80,
      lines: 80,
      statements: 80
    },
    'src/services/**/*.ts': {
      branches: 90,
      functions: 90,
      lines: 90,
      statements: 90
    },
    'src/entities/**/*.ts': {
      branches: 85,
      functions: 85,
      lines: 85,
      statements: 85
    },
    'src/controllers/**/*.ts': {
      branches: 80,
      functions: 80,
      lines: 80,
      statements: 80
    },
    'src/components/**/*.tsx': {
      branches: 70,
      functions: 70,
      lines: 70,
      statements: 70
    }
  }
}
```

## Coverage Reporting

### Local Development
During local development, developers should:
1. Run `npm run test:coverage` before submitting PRs
2. Review coverage reports in `coverage/` directory
3. Address any coverage gaps in new code
4. Document any approved exceptions

### CI/CD Pipeline
Coverage is checked automatically:
1. On every pull request
2. During nightly builds
3. Before production deployments

### Coverage Reports
Coverage reports include:
1. Line-by-line coverage data
2. Branch coverage analysis
3. Function coverage details
4. Uncovered lines report
5. Historical coverage trends

## Exemptions and Special Cases

### Allowed Exemptions
Some code may be exempted from coverage requirements:
1. Generated code
2. External library interfaces
3. Debug-only code
4. Platform-specific implementations
5. Test utilities

### Documentation Requirements
For any exempted code:
1. Document the reason for exemption
2. Get approval from tech lead
3. Add appropriate coverage ignore comments
4. Review exemptions quarterly

## Maintenance

### Regular Reviews
Coverage requirements should be reviewed:
1. At the start of each quarter
2. When adding new major features
3. During architectural changes
4. When updating testing strategies

### Adjusting Requirements
To modify coverage requirements:
1. Submit proposal with justification
2. Review impact on code quality
3. Update documentation
4. Adjust CI/CD pipeline
5. Communicate changes to team

## Best Practices

### Writing Testable Code
1. Follow SOLID principles
2. Use dependency injection
3. Avoid global state
4. Keep functions focused
5. Use interfaces for flexibility

### Improving Coverage
1. Write tests alongside code
2. Use TDD when appropriate
3. Focus on behavior coverage
4. Test edge cases
5. Use parameterized tests

### Common Pitfalls
1. Testing implementation details
2. Ignoring error paths
3. Incomplete mock coverage
4. Missing edge cases
5. Over-mocking
