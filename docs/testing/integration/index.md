# Integration Testing

## Overview
This directory contains integration tests that verify the correct interaction between multiple components, services, and systems within the game. Integration tests ensure that different parts of the application work together as expected.

## Directory Structure
```
integration-testing/
├── flows/           # End-to-end gameplay flow tests
├── services/        # Service interaction tests
├── systems/         # Game system integration tests
└── scenarios/       # Complex game scenario tests
```

## Test Categories

### Game Flow Tests
- Level progression sequences
- Save/load game flows
- Menu navigation flows
- Game state transitions
- Scene transitions

### Service Integration Tests
- Service communication patterns
- Event propagation between services
- State synchronization
- Resource management
- Error handling and recovery

### System Integration Tests
- Combat system interactions
- Inventory system integration
- Quest system progression
- Achievement system triggers
- Player progression system

### Complex Scenarios
- Multi-entity interactions
- Physics-based gameplay
- AI behavior sequences
- Multiplayer interactions
- Performance-critical flows

## Testing Approach

### Test Setup
1. Initialize required services and systems
2. Set up test data and state
3. Configure mock external dependencies
4. Establish test environment
5. Define cleanup procedures

### Test Execution
1. Simulate real gameplay sequences
2. Test multiple component interactions
3. Verify state changes across systems
4. Validate event propagation
5. Check error handling and recovery

### Assertions
1. Verify system state consistency
2. Check data persistence
3. Validate event sequences
4. Confirm UI updates
5. Test performance metrics

## Best Practices

### Test Organization
- Group related scenarios
- Use descriptive test names
- Document complex setups
- Maintain test independence
- Follow consistent patterns

### Test Implementation
1. Use TestBed for component testing
2. Implement proper cleanup
3. Handle asynchronous operations
4. Mock external services
5. Monitor performance impact

### Common Patterns
```typescript
describe('Game Flow Integration', () => {
  let gameState: GameState;
  let eventBus: EventBus;
  let playerService: PlayerService;

  beforeEach(async () => {
    // Setup test environment
    gameState = await TestBed.createService(GameState);
    eventBus = await TestBed.createService(EventBus);
    playerService = await TestBed.createService(PlayerService);
  });

  it('should handle complete combat sequence', async () => {
    // Arrange
    const player = await playerService.createPlayer();
    const enemy = await gameState.spawnEnemy();

    // Act
    await gameState.initiateCombat(player, enemy);
    await player.attack(enemy);

    // Assert
    expect(enemy.health).toBeLessThan(100);
    expect(eventBus.getLastEvent()).toBe('COMBAT_ROUND_COMPLETE');
    expect(gameState.getCombatState()).toBe('ACTIVE');
  });
});
```

## Performance Considerations
- Monitor test execution time
- Optimize resource usage
- Clean up test data
- Use appropriate timeouts
- Handle memory management

## Debugging Tips
1. Use detailed logging
2. Monitor state changes
3. Track event sequences
4. Check timing issues
5. Verify cleanup procedures

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Timing Issues
- Use proper async/await
- Implement retry mechanisms
- Add appropriate delays
- Handle race conditions
- Monitor event order

### State Management
- Reset state between tests
- Verify initial conditions
- Track state changes
- Handle side effects
- Clean up resources

### Resource Management
- Close connections
- Release resources
- Clear caches
- Reset singletons
- Clean up test data

## Tools and Utilities

### Test Helpers
- Scene test bed
- Service factories
- State snapshots
- Event recorders
- Performance monitors

### Mocking Utilities
- Service mocks
- Network mocks
- Storage mocks
- Time manipulation
- Random generators
